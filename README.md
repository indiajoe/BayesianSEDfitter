Bayesian SED Fitter
===================

#Note: This is work in progress...

This tool is to fit SED models by combining Multiple Epoch and Multiple Instrument data by Hierarchical Bayesian Models.

We use PyMC monte carlo for fitting the model. 

Hierarchical Bayesian Models give the power to fit all the data together for complicated sources with time variablility, or sample of sources with certain shared parameters across the sample.
